# Unusual_Event_Detection

There could be some situations or places where immediate action against the strange event
is required. For instance, consider road traffic systems. In case of an accident, a person may
require quick help. According to the current scenario, if the accident captured by a camera
is marked by the respective person, he or she could take proper action towards it. But what
if they fail to make note of it, then it is possible to result in loss of lives or properties.
As mentioned in the above cases there is a need for smart surveillance systems and the current
ones. The objective of this project is to upgrade current systems so that it could solve
such issues and result in the improvement of lifestyle. If an unusual activity like the fight is
detected before it turns into combat it is possible to save the lives and properties of human
beings. For that, an improved surveillance system works as a tool to detect and keep track
and record such an event. As soon as such an event is detected responsible authorities
are alarmed and notified about it. For instance, in case of a fight, nearby police stations are
alarmed about the situation and the situation could be taken under control before it goes out
of hand.
